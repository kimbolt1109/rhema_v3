/**
 * The preload bridge — the ONLY thing the renderer may reach the main process through.
 *
 * Runtime constraints, all load-bearing:
 *
 *  - This file is bundled to **CommonJS** at `out/preload/index.cjs` and runs with
 *    `sandbox: true` (see `src/main/window.ts`). A sandboxed preload may use
 *    `contextBridge` and `ipcRenderer` and nothing else — no `node:fs`, no `node:path`,
 *    no `process` poking. Adding a Node import here breaks the window at load time, not
 *    at build time, so it will only be discovered on a service day.
 *  - `@shared/ipc` is safe to import because it is types plus two frozen string maps: it
 *    pulls in no runtime dependency (its `config`/`log`/`obs`/`result` imports are all
 *    `import type` and erase to nothing).
 *
 * Security posture (docs/v2-notes/PROTOCOL.md §2.3 and §2.5):
 *
 *  - **No raw channel string and no `ipcRenderer` handle crosses the bridge.** The renderer
 *    gets named, typed methods only, so it is structurally unable to invoke an arbitrary
 *    channel. v2's blueprint marks exposing `ipcRenderer` itself as a critical defect; the
 *    grouped `VergerApi` shape in `@shared/ipc` exists precisely so this file never needs a
 *    generic `invoke`.
 *  - **The `IpcRendererEvent` is stripped before the callback runs.** That object carries a
 *    `sender` handle; forwarding it would hand the renderer back the very capability the
 *    bridge exists to withhold. Subscribers receive the payload and nothing else.
 *  - **Event names are checked against `IPC_EVENT_VALUES` at runtime**, so a main process
 *    that starts pushing on an unlisted channel cannot make this file register a listener
 *    for it.
 *
 * Nothing here throws: every method returns a `Promise<Result<T>>` produced by the main
 * process, and every `on*` returns an unsubscribe that is safe to call more than once.

   *    `{ record: false }` to pass. Standing Rule 3 — whenever streaming starts, OBS local
   *    recording starts too, because the internet wobbles and a service is un-repeatable —
   *    is enforced here by the absence of a parameter, not by a default value some future
   *    caller could override. Widening this signature would mean editing `@shared/ipc` first.
   *  - **There is no `stopRecording`, no `stopStream`, no per-step verb.** The renderer can ask
   *    to go live and ask to end, and that is the whole surface. It cannot half-tear-down a
   *    service, and it cannot react to a failed step by stopping the parts that are working.
   *
   * `start()` and `end()` resolve with a `GoLiveState`, not with a boolean, and `onState`
   * pushes the same whole snapshot on every change — including per-step progress while the

   * transitioned) that is the most likely real failure. A control window that reloads

   * streaming and recording — the app must never wedge the broadcast as a reaction to its own
   * error, so there is no path from a failed promise here to a stopped output.

   *
   * Read this group as the **manual** slide/media driver first and the automation seam second.
   * `advance()` and `back()` take no argument and `fireCue` takes only an id: an operator holding
   * SPACE can drive an entire service through these three methods with no ASR, no cue engine and
   * no network. Phase 8's plan-follower will move the same pointer through the same channels —
   * it gets no privileged path of its own, which is what makes "a manual move always wins"
   * implementable rather than aspirational.
   *
   * Three shapes here are load-bearing:
   *
   *  - **Every method resolves with a whole `PlanState`** — plan, position, path, dirty flag and
   *    the last-fired cue in one snapshot. A control window that reloads mid-service recovers
   *    with one `getState()`, exactly as the overlay, camera and go-live panels do, and `onState`
   *    pushes the same snapshot after every change rather than a per-cue delta.
   *  - **`open`, `save` and `importDeck` take an *optional* path.** Omitting it is the normal
   *    case: the main process opens the native file dialog, because a renderer that could only
   *    act on paths it already knew would have no way to reach a file the operator has not
   *    previously named. A cancelled dialog resolves with the unchanged state and `ok: true` —
   *    backing out of a file picker is not an error and must never raise a toast.
   *  - **A path sent from here is a *request*, not an instruction.** The renderer is the
   *    less-trusted side; `src/main/ipc/register.ts` validates any supplied path (absolute,
   *    expected extension, really a file) before the plan service is allowed to touch it.
   *
   * `onImportProgress` exists because converting a deck is slow enough that a frozen-looking
   * window is a real failure mode. It is a progress feed only — `DeckImportProgress` carries a
   * stage, two counters and a message, and has no field for slide content. Imported slides are
   * opaque images end to end (Standing Rule 4); no slide text crosses this bridge because there

  /**
   * The ears (BLUEPRINT.md §4 and §8).
   *
   * This is the one group whose data flows *upward*. Everywhere else the renderer asks and the
   * main process answers; here the renderer is the source, because **only the renderer has
   * `getUserMedia`**. Electron's main process has no microphone without a native module, so
   * capture, resampling to 16 kHz mono s16le and device enumeration all happen in renderer code
   * and arrive here as `pushAudio` and `listDevices`. (The Phase 7 build prompt says "mic capture
   * in the main process"; that is not achievable in Electron without native code, and this is the
   * deviation.)
   *
   * Three shapes are load-bearing:
   *
   *  - **`pushAudio` is the hot path.** It fires every `ASR_CHUNK_MS` — ten times a second, for
   *    the length of a service — so it carries a bare `ArrayBuffer` and nothing else. There is no
   *    envelope object to allocate per chunk and no timestamp field to keep in sync; the main side
   *    checks the buffer's *shape and size* rather than zod-parsing three kilobytes of binary ten
   *    times a second. It still resolves with a `Result<void>` like everything else, so a dead
   *    recogniser is a value the capture loop can read rather than a rejection it has to catch.
   *  - **Audio only ever goes one way.** There is no method here that returns audio, and
   *    `TranscriptSegment` has no field that could carry a sample. Raw audio reaches the main
   *    process, is recognised, and is gone.
   *  - **`onTranscript` delivers the draft/final contract unchanged.** A span of speech arrives as
   *    many `isFinal: false` segments sharing one stable `id`, each *replacing* the previous, then
   *    exactly one `isFinal: true` that supersedes them all — and the local adapter's fast draft
   *    model works the same way (`isDraft: true`, later replaced by the small model's final).
   *    Consumers key on `id` and replace; appending before `isFinal` is what makes a transcript
   *    flicker gibberish.
   *
   * `not-configured` (no `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, no local model) is an ordinary resolved value, not a
   * rejection: `getStatus()` succeeds, the panel goes red, and the operator drives the service by
   * hand exactly as before (Standing Rule 1 and Standing Rule 5). Nothing in this group can block
   * the operator, because nothing in it is on the path between a keypress and a cue.

   *    (`syncToActual` in `@shared/cue`), and a confirm arriving after that is a no-op rather than
   *    a race the operator loses.
   *  - **There is no method that makes automation more aggressive than the mode allows.**
   *    `setMode` is the whole dial. A cue's own `confirmAlways`, a below-threshold confidence and
   *    an unresolved verse each BLOCK an auto-fire; nothing on this bridge can compel one.
   *  - **`panic()` takes no argument and cannot fail usefully.** It halts automation and nothing
   *    else — it never touches the stream, the recording, OBS or the overlay. `resume()` is

   * verified public-domain source. **No verse text is authored in this repository** (Standing Rule
   * 4), and the detectors on the other side of this bridge emit REFERENCES only — `CueSuggestion`
   * carries a `ScriptureReference`, which has no text field at all.
